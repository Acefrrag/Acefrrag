Hi there, my name is Michele (pronounced Mih-keh-leh), but friends usually call me Micky. I am an MSc graduate in Mechatronics at University of Trento. I like chess ♟️ ,(salsa) dancing 🕺, electronics⚡, coding 💻 and maths 📚.

💼I am currently employed @ [Xepics Italia](https://www.xepics.com/pe/) as a Firmware Developer where I work primarily with C, Matlab and Labview. I am also in charge of hardware troubleshooting and technical service.
